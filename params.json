I saw that they had added some custom support for MHN honeypot through some web sockets.  I decided to learn a little node.js and built a little node app hosts the web page and has a listener that listens on UDP 514 for any incoming messages, looks for IP addresses in the message, does a quick ip-geo lookup, and passes the coordinates to the web page, where your browser draws the arcs. The I figured you can configure anything you want to forward syslog messages to port 514.  Its still a little buggy, but works for the most part.\r\n",
